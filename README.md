# funny-system
Mix of exploration and story. May be funny. You can start your journey by exiting your ship and reading the recorder floating on the water.

The game contains five systems, three of which are named after their color. There's Blue, Red, Black and Solare, then finally O.S.M. and P.I.S.I.T.B. Not enough? Here's some screenshots:
