		<Text>BOBER: Above it is an engraving that looks much different, and we can't seem so understand it. The picture is of a large star, a ringed planet with a terrestrial moon, a planet with repeated symbols that has a gas moon, and a planet made of sand and water with two moons. That final planet is circled.</Text>

		<Text>BOBER: Update, it's been a few minutes, and we found the system the planet is in. The planet of interest is located in a system with a red star, so we'll have to go interstellar.</Text>

		<Text>BILLY: We'll go to that red system. We'll also construct black holes around Blue to warp to and from each system. That will make travel easier.</Text>

		<Text>KATHERYNE: Great idea! Let's go to the red system! Oh, and remember the planet we're looking for has two moons with sand and water flowing into it.</Text>
