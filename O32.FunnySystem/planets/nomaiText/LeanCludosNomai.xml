		<Text>BABYASS: Above it is an engraving that looks much different, and we can't seem so understand it. The picture is of a large star, a ringed planet with a terrestrial moon, a planet with repeated symbols that has a gas moon, and a planet made of sand and water with two moons. That final planet is circled.</Text>

		<Text>BITCHASS: Hear me out, what if this is another star system? I feel like I've seen those planets before... but I don't recall where. Launch a probe up, and set the camera to target the largest star.</Text>

		<Text>BABYASS: Update, it's been a few minutes, and we found the system the planet is in. The planet of interest is located in a system with a red star, so we'll have to go interstellar.</Text>

		<ParentID>8</ParentID>
		<Text>BITCHASS: We'll go to that red system. We'll also construct black holes around Blue to warp to and from each system. That will make travel easier.</Text>

		<Text>KICKASS: Great idea! Let's go to the red system! Oh, and remember the planet we're looking for has two moons with sand and water flowing into it.</Text>
